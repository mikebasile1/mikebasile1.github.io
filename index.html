    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio have helped me grow both technically and 
      professionally. Over the past two years, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience that has prepared me for a 
      career in software engineering. Working on group projects taught me how to collaborate effectively using tools 
      like GitHub and Agile methods. Sharing responsibilities and coordinating with others improved my communication 
      skills and helped me learn how to clearly explain technical concepts, especially when gathering or presenting 
      requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      My understanding of data structures and algorithms deepened through assignments that required building 
      efficient solutions using trees, hash maps, and sorting techniques. I also applied Big-O analysis to optimize 
      performance. In software engineering courses, I created full-stack projects using Java, JavaScript, and Python, 
      and integrated databases like MySQL and SQLite. I learned how to follow coding standards, write maintainable code,
      design schemas, and implement CRUD operations. Security was another major focus, where I gained experience writing 
      secure code, validating input, and preventing vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program has given me the confidence and skills to succeed in the field of computer science. Creating 
      this ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on my growth and share the knowledge and values that I bring to 
      future opportunities.

    <h2>Education Review</h2>
    <p>
      This section focuses on a review of the work performed to develop my electronic portfolio in preparation 
      for embarking on a career with the Computer Science field.
    </p>

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>
    <p>
      This section showcases key projects and assignments that demonstrate my skills in software engineering,
      algorithms, databases, and full-stack development.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Looking back on my journey, I’ve grown from a beginner to someone confident in designing and building
      complete systems. This capstone solidifies that growth and provides a bridge into professional practice.
